summary: Retrospective using ORID 
---

ORID is an acronym for Objective, Reflective, Interpretational and Decisional.  

​      

## ORID Method in Retro    

Yet another pattern in retrospective meeting - ORID



### Objective

Start with " The fact is ... /The data shows... etc." to state the fact in the last sprint

No item limited

Limited in three minutes

​    

​    


### Reflective

Start with "I am happy, because .../I feel sad, because ..." according the fact in the previous step written by yours and others.

Limited in three minutes

​    

​    

### Interpretational

Start with "My opinion is ..."according the fact in previous two steps

Limited in three minutes

List the opitions we can achieve 

​    

### Decisional

Based on the opinions in Step Interpretational, vote on three objectives in Step Objective to follow up, three votes each person

Discuss the "DoD" of each item voted.

Discuss Who is the owner

"Is is SMART ?": A good follow-up plan should align the "SMART"

SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound

*Setting*: 

END OF THE TEAM’S RETROSPECTIVE MEETING

### Objective     

<u>GLAUCON:</u> "How many items can I write in this Step ?"
