Yet another pattern in retrospective meeting - ORID

​    

### Objective

Start with " The fact is ... /The data shows... etc." to state the fact in the last sprint

No item limited

Limited in three minutes

​    

​    


### Reflective

Start with "I am happy, because .../I feel sad, because ..." according the fact in the previous step written by yours and others.

Limited in three minutes

​    

​    

### Interpretational

Start with "My opinion is ..."according the fact in previous two steps

Limited in three minutes

List the opitions we can achieve 

​    

### Decisional

Based on the opinions in Step Interpretational, vote on three objectives in Step Objective to follow up, three votes each person

Discuss the "DoD" of each item voted.

Discuss Who is the owner

"Is is SMART ?": A good follow-up plan should align the "SMART"

SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound

## Yet another example of ORID approach       



In honor of Steve McConnell，the author of "***Code Complete 2***"，the second   

​      

*Characters*: 

THRASYMACHUS A green, theoretical purist who believes everything he reads 

CALLICLES A battle-hardened veteran from the old school—a “real” programmer 

GLAUCON A young, confident, hot-shot computer jock 

ISMENE A senior programmer tired of big promises, just looking for a few practices that work 

SOCRATES The wise old programmer  

*Setting*: 

END OF THE TEAM’S RETROSPECTIVE MEETING

​     

### Objective     

<u>GLAUCON:</u> "How many items can I write in this step?"

<u>SOCRATES:</u> "There is no limit, Glaucon."

<u>THRASYMACHUS:</u> "Is there any restriction on the Objective?"

<u>SOCRATES:</u> "Just state the fact you care in the last sprint."

​    

### Reflective    

<u>ISMENE</u>: "It seems that we are discussing about the room that we can improve, but is it valuable to share our happiness in this step ? Maybe ... I think ... huh ... I feel relax in this sprint without unhappiness."

<u>SOCRATES:</u> "What do you think about that, Thrasymachus?"

<u>THRASYMACHUS:</u> "Theoretically, happiness is greate power to influence the people and motivate them."

<u>GLAUCON:</u> "I agree with that, Thrasymachus. Why should we stay in a team always strugles in trouble, we are in the team with great teamwork and  can breakthrough everything."

<u>CALLICLES:</u> "Seriously speaking, we should have room to improve, but I extoll the kind of happiness that comes from a pursuit, the pursuit of climing the higher mountain."
